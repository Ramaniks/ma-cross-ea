===========

Simple moving average crossover expert advisor for Metatrader 4, in MQL4.

This EA opens a trade when the short period MA crosses the long period MA. Stop loss and target profit are set according to user-configurable parameters.

This is a simple EA that produces good results on certain currency pairs, during certain time periods.

I provide no guarantees as to the usefulness of this EA. No trade recommendations are implied as I'm not a financial advisor.
